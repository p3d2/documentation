# MMD User guide PIR uc 605 (IR camera)

## Must read before first use (or after long time without using) the IR camera

- Do not move the IR camera of Lab C132 without warning the responsible.

- Read the safety measures notes on how to safely handle the IR camera. In case of doubt, check the [manual](https://aaltofi.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/MMD910/Shared%20Documents/General/Onboarding%20and%20guidelines/Guides/Infrared%20Camera/InfraTec_Manual_PIR-uc-605.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=OjXueS) before asking for help.
  
  <details>
        <summary>Notes on securing the device</summary>
  <p> 1. The PIR uc 605 is an optical measuring device. Handle it with care. Avoid soiling, especially on the optical surfaces.</p>
  <p> 2. Depending on the design of the lens interface, the device comes with protection class IP40 (screw thread). </p>
  <p> 3. Please note the information given in the technical data (see chapter 4 Dimensions – page 6) and in the Quick Start Guide (see chapter 7 Quick Start – page 10 ff.) for use, storage and transport of the device. </p>
  <p> 4. When transporting the PIR uc 605, use only the supplied transportation case* or transport packaging*.</p>
  <p> 5. Please note that opening the housing of the camera is only reserved to the manufacturer. Any manipulation by other persons is not permitted and will invalidate the warranty. </p>
  <p> 6. Only use accessories or spare parts explicitly recommended by the manufacturer for the PIR uc 605. Otherwise, malfunction or damage may occur. Warranty claims are excluded for any resulting damage. </p>
  <p> 7. The PIR uc 605 must not be directed directly at the sun or other sources of high radiation (e.g. laser), either when in operation or switched off, as this may cause irreversible modifications to the microbolometer detector. The origin of these modifications can be clearly identified. The manufacturer does not accept any guarantee for damage caused in this way. </p>
  <p> 8. Furthermore, it is essential to prevent the sun or other high‐energy radiation sources from entering the field of view of PIR uc 605 indirectly via reflecting surfaces! </p>
  <p> 9. When not in use, always attach the lens cap supplied with the PIR uc 605. </p>
  <p> 10. Do not remove the lenses in rooms with high dust exposure or humidity, as the specified degree of protection cannot be guaranteed when the lens is removed. </p>

## Connecting the camera

0. Have a first look at the [manual](https://aaltofi.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/MMD910/Shared%20Documents/General/Onboarding%20and%20guidelines/Guides/Infrared%20Camera/Manual_IRBIS3_Print.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=LCZ6sN) of the software. You can start at page 18 (Chapter 7).

1. Turn on the PC

2. Connect LAN cable (8) to PC and IR cam. Connect Power cable (3) to IR cam (1). System initialisation can be recognised by the camera‐internal shutter noise and the flashing LED on the Ethernet port. The system is ready for operation and can be connected to the software.

7. After the connection is established, a live image from the camera will be displayed (live button in the camera menu is active). The live image display can be activated or deactivated by pressing the 'Live' button. The display of the thermal image can be adjusted or optimised using the corresponding tools of IRBIS® 3.1 (selection of the appropriate temperature scale and a suitable colour palette). 'Measure' menu contains all sorts of tools to select areas and points. 'Camera' menu can take snapshots and videos of your measurements. Check point 0 and read the manual for specific measurements, calibrations and other types of reports.

8. To turn off the camera, unplug the AC adapter from the wall outlet. No further steps are required. Remember to cover the lens.

9. Store the IR camera and respective cables in the designed space.
