To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

### Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a `>` on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Nested Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a `>>` in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Blockquotes with Other Elements

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you'll need to experiment to see which ones work.

```
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> <h4 class="no-anchor">The quarterly results look great!</h4>
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
> *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

### Blockquotes Best Practices

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th>✅&nbsp; Do this</th>
      <th>❌&nbsp; Don't do this</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code class="highlighter-rouge">
        Try to put a blank line before...<br><br>

        > This is a blockquote<br><br>

        ...and after a blockquote.
        </code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code class="highlighter-rouge">
        Without blank lines, this might not look right.<br>
        > This is a blockquote<br>
        Don't do this!
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
