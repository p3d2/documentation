- Ethics and Management are intended for project management only
- Upload all unprocessed data in `Raw Data` folders and create a README.md file for each experiment
	- Text data include databases, survey (txt, doc, ...)
	- Numeric data include all numerical measurements (csv, spss, xls)
	- Multimedia data include images, videos and audio (raw, avi, jpg, png,...)
	- Other specific data (add this in case of need)
	- Processed data should be placed in users folders; remember to include the folder locations in both readme (raw should point to the processed and processed to raw)
	- Subfolders should have YYYMMDD-Tag format
- Users folder should include all processed data; no specific folder organization is imposed at this level but keep it user-friendly
- Outputs should include final documents and useful data (documents can be still updated if required)
- **README** and other guides can be found on `General/Data Management/READ.me files`. Create your template if you find it useful for a specific technique.
For instance, a README template for the microscope can have already some pre-filled fields and description that is duplicated from experiment to experiment and specific info that should always be mentioned, like magnification or scale bar info.

Check `markdown-cheat-sheet.md` for the syntax (basic elements like heading, bold, italic, etc.)
